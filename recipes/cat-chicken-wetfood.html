<h1>The ultimate cat wet food</h1>
<img src="../images/cat-eating.jpg" alt="cat eating meat" width="300">
<p>The story about this recipe befan when I adopted 
    a sweet little kitten called Noisette</p>
    <p>All though cats can very well live healthy 
        and long while eating only dry food, my 3 month old baby 
        unfortunately arrived home under fed and covered with fleas. </p>
  s      <p> The first thing that I decided to do after the flea 
        situation was taken care of was to get her back to a decent weight 
        for her size and age as quick as possible.</p>
<p>I went to the nearest grocery store and all I've found was a kitten food 
    that would of cost about one dollar a day to give her a portion 
    of wet food in <strong>addition</strong> of the 25 ish dollars a 
    month for her dry food!!</p>
    <p> I live in Mauritious and I do have to state that the average 
        salery is around 300 dollars a month and I think that those
         prices for only a cat is outragous... </p>
    <p> So this is when I started hours long research of how to 
        make the best cost effitient cat food.  </p>
    <p>It turned out that from what I've found, the best option Is: 
        <h3>100% meat!!!</h3> and chicken is a great food for them!!!</p>
<p>So this is how I started feeding Noisette 20 grammes of chicken everyday 
    in addition of he dry food and I am happy to say that she is now 
    in great shape!</p>
    <h1>Ingrediants</h1>
    <ul><li>Chicken</li>
    <li>Water</li>
<li>and that is all!!!</li>
</ul>
<p>I use an instant pot but you can of course cook it in a regular pot,
    cooking time may vary</p>
    <h1>how to?</h1>
    <ol><li>Put the chicken in the pot with a little bit of water</li>
    <li>Set the instant pot to poultry option for 15 min</li>
<li>Let perssure relese naturally</li>
<li>Open lid and let it cool down for a few minutes</li>
<li>Transfer everything in a mixer or blender</li>
<li>Mix until the meat is all shreded</li>
<li>For longer conservation, scoop the preparation 
    in an ice cube tray and let it freeze </li>
<li>Ones frozen tranfer the cubes into an bag </li></ol>
<p> When it comes to giving her the food, I put a cube in 
    a plate and leave it 45 seconds in the microwave to thaw.</p>
    <p> After those 45 seconds, I add some water to the preparation 
        and mixe it all to make sure that everyting is at room 
        temperature.</p>
        <p>she got so demanding that I have to give her only half on the 
            morning and the other half on the evening, yes... 
            my cat is spoiled...</p>
            <p></p>
            <p></p>
            <p>So there you have it, the ultimate cat food that 
                garenties 100% meat and is deffinitely cheaper then factory made 
                food</p>
            <p> a chicken brest lasts her about one week and it costs
             me (in Mauritius) a little over $10 a month insted of 
             $30!</p>
