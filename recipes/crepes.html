<h1>How to make Crepes</h1>
<p>Comming from Britany, France, 
    they are an important part of my life, 
    everywhere I go in the world, I get to make and share with 
    friends a plate of crepes.</p>
<p> I always get surprised to see how many people are unaware of their origin.</p>
<p> I also get surprised of the reaction when trying them.</p>
<p> As it seems, a good crepe is apparentely hard to find outside of a proper 
    "creperie Bretonne" and most of the world have not experienced the simple yet 
    amazing flavors of a tipical <em>crepe Bretonne</em>
</p>
<h1>Here is how I make it</h1>
<p>As a disclamer, even though I grew up in Britany, my parents did not, my recipe is
    based on friend's familly traditionnal recipes and techniques</p> 
<h1>For a decent stack of crepes, you need:</h1>
<ul>
    <li>250gr of flour</li>
    <li>3 eggs</li>
    <li>2/3Tbs of sugar</li>
    <li>About 50gr of <strong>salted butter</strong><em>
        the quality of the end product is highly affected
         by the quality of the butter you use.
    </em></li>
    <li>about 1/2 liter of milk</li>   
</ul>
<h1>how to proceed:</h1>
<ol>
    <li>In a pot, melt the butter on low fire</li>
    <li>In a big mixing bowl, mix the the flour and sugar</li>
    <li>In a small bowl, whisk the eggs</li>
    <li> Ones the butter is melted, add a little milk in it so that 
        it doesnt cook the eggs when you mix them together
    </li>
    <li>Ones the butter is melted but not burning hot, mix the butter 
        with the eggs</li>
        <li>Do like a little hole in the middle of the flour and sugar mixed 
            together and pour a little bit of the egg an butter mix</li> 
    <li>Add the rest of butter/egg mix and the milk gradualy to avoid crumbs</li>
    <li>Ones everything is mixed well, take a ladle and <em>oxigen</em> the batter</li>
    <li> do so by filling the laddle with batter bringing it 20/30 centimiter high and 
        pouring it back in the bowl 
        (without making a mess if possible)
    repeat the operation for about 2/3 minutes</li>
    <li>you are now ready for the cooking process</li>
</ol>
<p>Don't worry too much if your batter is the right constency, 
    it takes experience to know how it should be before cooking 
    the first crepe, the first crepe bieng the test subject that 
    will allow you to adjust the amount of flour or milk to add.  </p>    
<h1>The cooking process: </h1>
<p>As I have had the opportunity to make crepes in friends 
    kitchens while traveling, I've had to addapt and work with the pans that they have.</p>
    <p>I am happy to annouce that a <em>"crepe pan"</em> is absolutely not needed and on the contrary... 
    some of those pans are sold in tourists traps and are much more 
    impractical to use then a good old non stick pan that you can 
    pretty much found in any household</p>
    <p> Rather then explaining a process to follow, 
        I will present to you my optimum setting knowing 
        that anyone can adapt from that </p>
        <ul>
            <li>My favorite pan to work with is a lightweith non stick one</li>
            <li>Cooking on gas to get the temperature very high when needed</li>
            <li>A little bowl with olive oil and I use a paper towel to spread 
                the oil on the pan </li>
            <li>A wood or plastic spatula that has a flat head, that is thin 
                and flexible enough to 
                bring it under the crepe without breaking it</li>
            <li>Two plates:<ul><li>one to place the cooked crepes</li><li>
                one to place the crepes that you messed up so that you can 
                eat them right away(some people call it greedy but it's 
                really just to hide the evidence)</li></ul></li>
        </ul>
