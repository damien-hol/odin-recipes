<h1>Basil Pesto</h1>
<img src="../../odin-recipes/images/basil.jpg" alt="image of Basil leaves" width="300">
<p>To me, pesto is one of those food items 
    that everyone loves but don't know how 
    simple it is to make.</p>
<p> Forget about the official recipe that 
    require pine nuts and peccorino or 
    parmesan cheese that you would need 
    to buy in order to make it! </p>
<p>To me, pesto can be made with pretty much 
    any hard cheese and as for the nuts?</p>
<h2>You don't even need them!!</h2>
<p>I mean sure, I love the texture and the 
    flavor of almonds, walnuts or even hazelnuts 
    in my pesto.</p>
<p>But if you don't have any of those in your 
    kitchen or someone around you is alergic, 
    you can very easely ommit them and your 
    pesto could still be the best you've ever 
    made so far.</p> 
<h1>For an amazing pesto</h1>
<h3>You would need:</h3>
<ul><li>Fresh basil</li>
<li>Fresh garlic</li>
<li>Lemons</li>
<li>Olive oil</li>
<li>A handfull of nuts (optionnal)</li>
<li>A fair amount of your prefferd hard cheese<p>my favorites are</p><ul>
    <li>Mozzarela mixed with chedar for a pizza or pasta</li>
    <li>Swiss cheese to go with a salad</li>
    <li>Parmesian and peccorino if i feel like being authentic</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Salt and pepper</li>
</ul>
<h3>As for tools</h3>
<ul>
    <li>A blender (or mixer)</li>
    <li>A lemon squeezer or a fork to get the 
        juice out (please try to 
        avoid the seeds in the blender...)</li>
    <li>A spatulla and a container</li>
</ul>
<p>Now that we have everything ready, </p>
<h2>Lets start</h2>

<p>You will notice that i didn't give you any 
    proportions as pesto should be made with 
    love, not with mesurement units</p>
<p> That said, free yourself from the control
     freakyness comming from all those cooking
    books and find your inner chef who works 
    with guts rather then a mesuring cup</p>
    <p>From a big pack of basil, I would use:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>One lemon</li>
        <li>Two garlic cloves</li>
        <li>A small handfull of nuts</li>
        <li>And big handfull of cheese</li>
        <li>A pinch of salt and pepper (make sure to taste the cheese before adding salt, i usualy don't add any salt at all)</li>
        <li>And two or three onces of olive oil</li>
    </ul>
<p>This list is really approximate as I 
    personaly don't care for lemon and I 
    love cheese, it really should be different 
    between one person to another</p>
<h2>How to proceed:</h2>
<ol>
    <li>After washing the basil, throw it in the blender</li>
    <li>Add in the lemon juice, the olive oil, the garlic, the nuts, cheese and salt and pepper</li>
    <li>Close the lid of the blender and <strong>push the button. </strong></li>
    <li>After everything is mixed together, make sure to tate the pesto</li>
    <li>Adjust it adding salt or lemon or oil if needed</li>
    <li>Pour it all in the container</li>
    <li>Et Voila!!</li>
</ol>
<p>for better conservation, I recommand a 
    layer of olive oil on the pesto when in the 
    fridge, it protects it from oxidation.</p>
