<img src="../images/red-chlli.jpg" width="300">
<p>chilli paste is just the best!!!</p>
<p>I don't really eat spicy food and I never made chilli myself...</p>
<p>Which is why I belive that I am the best person you can
     find to recommend my <strong>improvised</strong> <em>
        "I guess it will turn out good" </em>
        <strong>strawberry chilli paste</strong> </p>
<h4><strong>ps: Do not try this at home</strong></h4>
     <p><h1>ingridients</h1>

<ul>
 <li>Extra virgin olive oil</li>   
<li>Garlic powder</li>
<li>Black pepper</li>
<li>Strawberry sirup</li>
<li>bread crumbs</li>
<li>A pinch of salt</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p><h1>In that <strong>very specific order:</strong></h1>
<ol>
    <li>in a mixing bowl, trow in a handfull 
        of Extra Virgin Olive Oil</li>
        <li><strong><h3>good job...
        </h3> now go wash your hands...</strong></li>
        <li>did you use soap?</li>
        <li>then go wash them again <strong>and with soap this time!!</strong></li>
    <li>add three grammes of garlic powder</li>
    <li> put in five grammes of black pepper 
    (it is verry important that the sirup is my favorite brand)</li>
    <li> mix until your arm hurts</li>
    <li>then add in the delissious sirup (not more then a coffee spoon
         because we don't want to 
        waste it as the preparation will be discusting!)
</li><li>at this point, just add the bread crumbs and the salt, 
    who cares..</li>
<li>pour the preparation in your favorite teapot and then trow it 
against the wall!!</li>
