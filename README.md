# odin-recipes
This is a repo related to Odin Project foundation course where a recipe website is created for training purposes.
In this repo, I am planning to create a website where all the webpages will be connected to each other via relative paths.
my project will be to make pages of incredebly wrong recipes and offer to go and check out proper recipes of the same food via absolute path links that would redirect readers to other websites. 
I will be able to practice on simple html tags such as lists, paragraphes with different headings, image insertions and links.
This repo is also good practice for the use of githubs where I will practice on git commits and commit messages.
Let's let the webpage developing carrer begin!!
